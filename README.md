# prometheus-pcf-tile
Prometheus Pivotal Cloud Foundry Product Tile

This tile is based on [Prometheus BOSH Release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/prometheus-boshrelease). In addition to Prometheus exporters included in Prometheus BOSH Release, this tile also includes [Prometheus Node Exporter BOSH Release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/node-exporter-boshrelease). Node exporter is a runtime add-on, which runs on all VMs created by Bosh to give detail VM metrics (memory, cpu, etc.)
